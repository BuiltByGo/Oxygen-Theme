Simple theme by BBG to make life easier:
Simply upload this as a theme and enable it in WordPress when using Oxygen. 
As Oxygen doesn't use themes or even loads them on the frontend - so this affects nothing, it just avoids the potential conflicts of non-active themes updating and breaking the site.
There is a plugin add-on that allows the linking of theme based template overrides. which can found here: https://github.com/BuiltByGo/oxygen-template-override-plugin
